        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died
        July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of
        India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs.
        He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras
        Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
        In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the
        first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
        Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped
        earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”
        From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
        scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.
        His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
        established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.
